          others' door. One night, the house owner saw him and asked why did not
          you even have a warm coat. The old man replied I do not have any. - So
          poor of you, responded by the guy mercifully. Wait me a minute, I will
          go in and give you one. The home owner then was too busy and forgot
          his word to give the old man a coat. Then after waking up, in the
          morning, the guy opened the door and saw the homeless man already
          dead. The old man did not die because of being cold outside, but the
          guy promise instead. Please your promise is so important to others.
          It's like everything, so never promise what you can't do.
